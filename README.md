The search container allows users to perform web searches by entering keywords. You can click on the search bar, type your query, and press enter or click the search button to initiate a search. Additionally, there are options for image-based search and voice-based search.

Towards the bottom of the website, you will find a section for footer links. These links can be customized to include your preferred websites or resources. The icons associated with each link can be modified to represent the appropriate platform.
